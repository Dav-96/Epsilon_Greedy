##### Imagine your company is running marketing campaigns based on emails. Naturally, some customers are more likely to open the emails and some are not. But before running any campaign, you know nothing about your customers. The only way to learn how likely a customer will open the email is to collect the data by sending them whole bunch of emails and observe the responding rate. The question is, how many emails do we have to send to all customer to establish statistical significance? If we send 100 emails to each customer, we probably be able get some idea of who is our optimal targets. But it is very inefficient! As the campaign goes, we want to reach to as much customer as possible as. Meanwhile, we also want to target the customer who has the highest respond rate, those are our optimal customers give the best reward. It is an explore-exploit tradeoff. The exploration, exploitation trade-off is a dilemma we frequently face in choosing between options. Should you choose what you know and get something close to what you expect (‘exploit’) or choose something you aren’t sure about and possibly learn more (‘explore’)? The challenge can exist in many different contexts. Such as marketing campaign, website A/B testing or your gambling strategies. The core of the challenge is essentially the same.
